# Portfolio Page

This is a simple portfolio page built with React and TypeScript, using the Vite build tool. It leverages Framer Motion to create smooth animations and transitions. This README provides instructions on how to set up, run, and customize the project.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/): Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git

   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd your-portfolio

3. Install the project dependencies:
   npm install

4. Running the Development Server
   To start the development server, run:
   npm run dev

This will launch the application and typically be available at http://localhost:3000. As you make changes to the code, the development server will hot-reload, allowing you to see your changes in real-time.

5. Building for Production
   npm run build

Customization
You can customize your portfolio by modifying the React components and styles in the project. Key files and directories to look out for include:

src directory: Contains your React components and application logic.
src/styles directory: Contains CSS or SCSS stylesheets for your components.
Deploying
To deploy your portfolio, you can use various hosting platforms, such as Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages, or your preferred web hosting service. Refer to their documentation for deployment instructions.
